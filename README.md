# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Created a dynamic webpage on UFO sightings, in an attempt to prove once and for all that aliens are real. In this webpage there is a table of UFO data that's stored as a JavaScript array. This table has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and uses JavaScript as the primary coding language.



## Results
What makes this webpage dynamic is that when a user enters criteria into the search bars, the table will automaticaly filter for the criteria that is entered. For example, if a user wants to see all of the UFO sightings in the year 2010 and only in the state of New York, the user can simply enter the date and the state initials, and the table will update and show only the filtered data.

## Summary
One drawback to this design is that this is a direct string compare, so the user will have to know which data points to enter. 

One solutions would be to create a drop down for each filter, so the user would not have to know the exact spelling to filter.

Another solution would be to auto-fill each search box so the user would not need to know the exact input needed to properly filter.
